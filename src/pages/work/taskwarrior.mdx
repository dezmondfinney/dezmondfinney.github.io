import Taskwarrior from "../../components/taskwarrior.svelte";

<div class="prose">

## A useful starter TODO
The todo demos that everyone makes for these frameworks are usually pretty simple. I wanted to make something that I could actually use. I've been using Taskwarrior for a while now, and I wanted to make a GUI for it. I'm not a designer, so I'm sure it could use some work, but it's functional.
