### Welcome to my public journal! 

This is a space where I will be sharing selections from my private journal, documenting my personal growth, family experiences, and random philosophical thoughts.

{/* In terms of personal growth, I plan to reflect on the lessons I've learned and the progress I've made in various aspects of my life. This could include self-improvement practices, overcoming challenges, or achieving goals. By sharing these experiences, I hope to inspire others on their own journey of self-discovery and development. */}

{/* Family plays a significant role in our lives, so expect to read about the joys and challenges that come with it. Whether it's sharing heartwarming moments or discussing strategies for maintaining healthy relationships, family will be a recurring theme in this journal. */}

{/* I am also fascinated by philosophy and love exploring different concepts. From ethics to epistemology and theology, I intend to delve into these subjects and share my thoughts on various philosophical ideas. It will be an opportunity for intellectual exploration and stimulating discussions. */}

### What is this about?
Beyond introspection and contemplation, this journal will also serve as a platform for documenting my ongoing projects both at home and on the internet. Whether it's DIY home maintenance projects, organizing my garage workspace, tending to my rear garden or revamping the front yard, there will be plenty of practical ideas for readers who enjoy making things with their own hands.

Overall, the primary focus of this journal is creation â€“ creating a better version of myself through personal growth efforts, creating meaningful connections with family members, creating thought-provoking discussions around philosophy, and creating tangible things through various projects.

### Where to next?
I invite you to join me on this journey of self-discovery, learning, and creation as we explore the depths of our existence while embracing the beauty of making things. Together, let's grow personally and create joyfully!

Something that I want to share.
