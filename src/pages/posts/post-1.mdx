This is a space where I will be sharing selections from my private journal, documenting my personal growth, family experiences, and random philosophical thoughts.

### What is this about?
Beyond introspection and contemplation, this journal will also serve as a platform for documenting my ongoing projects both at home and on the internet. Whether it's DIY home maintenance projects, organizing my garage workspace, tending to my rear garden or revamping the front yard, there will be plenty of practical ideas for readers who enjoy making things with their own hands.

Overall, the primary focus of this journal is creation â€“ creating a better version of myself through personal growth efforts, creating meaningful connections with family members, creating thought-provoking discussions around philosophy, and creating tangible things through various projects.

### Where to next?
I invite you to join me on this journey of self-discovery, learning, and creation as we explore the depths of our existence while embracing the beauty of making things.
